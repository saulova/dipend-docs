Dipend is a lightweight and flexible dependency injection library, making it easier to manage dependencies in modular applications.

### Features

- **Interface-based Dependency Injection**: Use interfaces as references for dependencies, ensuring strong type safety.
- **Mapped Dependencies**: Register and resolve multiple implementations of the same interface by key. This allows you to map different behaviors or strategies to specific identifiers and retrieve them dynamically at runtime based on context.
- **Singleton, Transient and Per Context (python) Support**: Easily configure lifetime scopes for your services.
- **Minimal Setup**: Get started quickly.
- **Easy to Extend**: Open and flexible architecture.

### Why Dipend?

While many dependency injection libraries exist, **Dipend** fully supports using **interfaces** as references for dependency resolution without needing extra boilerplate or manual token management.

This means you can register and retrieve implementations by their interfaces directly, preserving **clean principles** while keeping your code strongly typed and maintainable.
